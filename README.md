Alma

Alma is a statically-typed stack-based programming language, for computers!

```
print "Hello world!"
```

note: I have some Big Ideas for how to rewrite some of the
architecture for this. So I might end up rewriting most of
it, keeping around the parsing, type-inference, and
interactive-mode code, but rewriting the actual code that
handles all the data, because it's kind of inefficient and
prone to memory leaks at the moment.
